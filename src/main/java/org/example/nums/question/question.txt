**Question: For Loop Puzzles**

Any of the three parts in a for loop can be empty, and there can be multiple statements in Initialization or Operation separated by commas.

```java
MyNumber number = new MyNumber(9);

number.isPrime(); // Is a number Prime?
// Hint: 5 => true, 7 => true, 11 => true, 6 => false

int sum = number.sumUptoN(); // Sum of numbers up to n?
// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6

int sumOfDivisors = number.sumOfDivisors();

number.printANumberTriangle();
// 1
// 1 2
// 1 2 3
// 1 2 3 4
// 1 2 3 4 5
```

1. Write Java code to determine whether the number stored in the `MyNumber` object is prime. Provide an explanation of how your code works.

2. Write Java code to calculate the sum of numbers up to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is the number stored in the `MyNumber` object. Explain the logic of your code.

3. Implement a Java method within the `MyNumber` class to calculate and return the sum of divisors for the number stored in the object. Provide the code for this method and explain how it works.

4. Develop a Java method within the `MyNumber` class to print a number triangle pattern as shown in the example. Include the code for this method and explain the logic behind it.

Please provide the code and explanations for each of these tasks.
