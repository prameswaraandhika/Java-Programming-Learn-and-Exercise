**Question:**

You have a `Student` class that contains the name of a student and an array of scores. Given the following code:


int[] scores = {97, 98, 100};
Student student = new Student("NameStudent", scores);
System.out.println("length: " + student.getLengthOfScores());
System.out.println("max: " + student.getMaxScore());
System.out.println("min: " + student.getMinScore());
System.out.println("avg: " + student.getAverageScores());


Write the `Student` class with methods to calculate and retrieve the following statistics for the given scores:

1. `getLengthOfScores()`: Returns the number of scores in the array.

2. `getMaxScore()`: Returns the highest score in the array.

3. `getMinScore()`: Returns the lowest score in the array.

4. `getAverageScores()`: Returns the average score rounded to two decimal places.

Include the necessary attributes and methods in the `Student` class to achieve this.
